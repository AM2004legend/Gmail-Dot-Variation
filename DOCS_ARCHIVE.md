## Why This Archive Exists

During cleanup (Nov 30, 2025), we had 25+ overlapping documentation files. All their essential content has been merged into:
- `DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete guide (getting started + reference + troubleshooting)
- `SUPABASE_COMPLETE.md` - Database details

This archive file preserves the list of what was consolidated for record-keeping purposes.
